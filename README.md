# Project Description
This is a game where everyone can paint each pixel in 20x20 board with blue, yellow, red colors. Players have 2 ways. One is to go to the website to play or you can play on warpcast, every time the user draws a pixel, he or she must fill in x-y coordinates and select a color. After completing the transaction, you need to reload to see the results.

# How it's Made
I built this project using frames.js and smartcontract deployed on base sepolia. The game includes a 20x20 board because if it is larger it will affect performance. In addition, it is limited to only 3 basic colors: red, yellow, blue. Every time the user draws a pixel, he or she must fill in x-y coordinates and select a color. After completing the transaction, you need to reload to see the results
